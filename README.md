A simple Haskell server WebSocket server with AngularJS application with D3 chart. Head over to [http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs/2014/01/06/haskell-websockets-and-d3-js/](http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs/2014/01/06/haskell-websockets-and-d3-js/) for details.

In short, clone this repository, and then run using ``cabal run`` (or if you have cabal < 1.18: ``cabal configure --enable-tests && cabal build && ./dist/build/ws/ws``). This starts the WebSocket server that listens on all local interfaces on port 9160. The AngularJS application in ``web/numbers.html`` then allows you to submit the expressions to have them executed. To get started, execute ``evendistr 25 [0..100] forever every 1000ms``, which generates even distribution of 100 numbers in the range 0..100, forever, with delay of 1s between every new set.
